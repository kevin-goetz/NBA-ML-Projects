This can take some time if the binder environment needs to be rebuilt (navigate from the parent folder to the projects notebooks).
 
### Offline

For the Notebooks two different virtual environments (venv) had to be set up because PyCaret only runs with a different version of Python and scikit-learn (older ones) compared to the newer versions that were used for the rest of the project. If you don't want to run the "Modelling with Pycaret" - Notebook it's sufficient to work with only one venv and install the **requirements.txt** file.

## Description

### What
Project on predicting (regression) a NBA rookie's career PER (Player Efficiency Rating averaged over his whole career) by just looking at his first season stats.

### How
By collecting data from a [Database (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/wyattowalsh/basketball) with SQL and enriching this data with further performance metrics by web scraping the website ["basketball-reference.com"](https://www.basketball-reference.com) for each individual player on all the years the player was active in the NBA.

The data was then preprocessed and condensed with a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and an RFE (Recurive Feature Elimination) before being modelled with a VotingRegressor (GradientBoostingRegressor & RandomForestRegressor) all in a ML Pipeline (see it below!) to avoid data leakage.

### Why
For NBA teams and their managers it is very important to foresee the future performance and the potential of a player at an early stage. the project is intended to help support the experts' qualitative assessment with a quantitative analysis and prediction.
