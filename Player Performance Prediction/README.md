This can take some time if the binder environment needs to be rebuilt (navigate from the parent folder to the projects notebooks).
 
### Offline

For the Notebooks two different virtual environments (venv) had to be set up because PyCaret only runs with a different version of Python and scikit-learn (older ones) compared to the newer versions that were used for the rest of the project. If you don't want to run the "Modelling with Pycaret" - Notebook it's sufficient to work with only one venv and install the **requirements.txt** file.

## Description

### What
Project on predicting (regression) a NBA rookie's career PER (Player Efficiency Rating averaged over his whole career) by just looking at his first season stats.

### How
By collecting data from a [Database (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/wyattowalsh/basketball) with SQL and enriching this data with further performance metrics by web scraping the website ["basketball-reference.com"](https://www.basketball-reference.com) for each individual player on all the years the player was active in the NBA.

The data was then preprocessed and condensed with a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and an RFE (Recurive Feature Elimination) before being modelled with a VotingRegressor (GradientBoostingRegressor & RandomForestRegressor) all in a ML Pipeline (see it below!) to avoid data leakage.

### Why
For NBA teams and their managers it is very important to foresee the future performance and the potential of a player at an early stage. the project is intended to help support the experts' qualitative assessment with a quantitative analysis and prediction.

### Results & Impact
With an R2 of 0.44 the results are not too impactful, there is still a lot to learn about the factors of a successful career (discussion in "Outlook" below) and also how to model the data in an optimal way. The model overestimates untalented rookies and also understimates talented rookies regarding their career PER. The following error plot summarizes this:

The table of the Top 5 rookies is to be taken with a grain of salt therefore:

| namePlayer| numberPickOverall | Age | Tm | Pos | Rookie_PER | Predicted_Career_PER |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| LaMelo Ball | 3 | 19.0 | CHO | PG | 17.5 | 19.48 |
| Isaiah Stewart | 16 | 19.0 | DET | C | 16.4 | 17.07 |
| Onyeka Okongwu | 6 | 20.0 | ATL | C | 16.8 | 16.69 |
| Tyrese Haliburton | 12 | 20.0 | SAC | PG | 16.2 | 16.32 |
| Kenyon Martin Jr. | 52 | 20.0 | HOU | SF | 14.6 | 16.07 |
