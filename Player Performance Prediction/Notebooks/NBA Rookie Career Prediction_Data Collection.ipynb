The additional player performance stats are from the crawled website [\"basketball-reference.com\"](https://www.basketball-reference.com) and list a plethora of stats, such as GS, MP, FG,\tFGA, FG%, 3P \t3PA, 3P%, 2P, 2PA, 2P%, ORB, DRB, STL ... & more. <br/> See [Lebron James](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/jamesle01.html) for example.
