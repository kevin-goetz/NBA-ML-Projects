# NBA Machine Learning Projects

## Access
Visit the sub-directories for in depth README-files on the specific project.

You'll find ![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg) and ![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)
links on top of those README files so you can view and even play around with the notebooks of the specific project.

## Description

### What
This directory is a collection of different Machine Learning (ML) projects that investigate different sources of NBA data to make
predictions (regression or classification) or do unsupervised ML tasks, such as clustering.


### How
By collecting data from a [Database (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/wyattowalsh/basketball) with SQL and enriching this data with further performance metrics by
web scraping the website ["basketball-reference.com"](https://www.basketball-reference.com) for each individual player. This approach slightly differs from project to project
and the preprocessing and modelling is completely different due to the nature of the problem (regression, classification, clustering, etc.).

### Why
Why NBA though? Because I like basketball (sports in general) and the NBA has a huge amount of free data available with lots of different metrics that you can play with :-) 

## Skills
Technical skills honed in those project are:
- Database Integration in a Python Script (SQL)
- Web Scraping (Requests, BeautifulSoup)
- Data Wrangling (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization & EDA (pandas-profiling, Matplotlib, Seaborn, missingno, plotly, Yellowbrick)
- Outlier Detection with Z-Scores, IQR and Isolation Forest (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- ML Pipelines (scikit-learn, PyCaret)
- Encoding, Imputation & Scaling / Transforming (scikit-learn)
- Feature Selection (RFE) & Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) (scikit-learn)
- Hyperparametertuning (scikit-learn)
- Ensemble Meta-Estimators (scikit-learn)
- and many more...

## Exemplary Machine Learning Pipeline

Here's a HTML representation of the ML pipeline of a regression problem ([Player Performance Prediction](https://github.com/kevin-goetz/NBA-ML-Projects/tree/main/Player%20Performance%20Prediction))
to get an overview of the process of preparing and modelling data in one of my projects.
